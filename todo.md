# Things that would be cool

## Pickaxe upgrading
Currently, the pickaxe upgrading system is a bunch of buttons, one for each pickaxe. Maybe consolidate those into just two buttons. 
- One to upgrade to a new 'tier' of pickaxe
- another to reforge the current pickaxe and try to aim for better stats (which would be much cheaper than the initial upgrade)

Also, make it visible what the best and lowest possible stats are for that particular pickaxe beside the pickaxe stats just so the players can see what the colors mean

## General upgrading
Recently, we added a general upgrades section, but there are none there yet. To avoid it taking up too much space, there should only be a limited amount of upgrades.

A forge, which would be a new upgrade path for the player similar to the pickaxe. This wil have different tiers, just like the pickaxes. 
- In order to craft the pickaxe of the next tier, the forge of that same level should be required!
- Each level of forge will unlock a new set of general upgrades that all must be purchased in order to move on to the next level of forge.
- Forges will cost a lot of different material types

### Upgrade types
- Faster exp gain
- Gain more ore per successful mine
- Pickaxe damage multipliers
- Faster tick rates


## Enchantment Changes
In order to allow for these above changes while still keeping enchantments feeling very powerful, all the multipliers that the enchantments currently effect will be applied ON TOP of all the other bonuses, which should amplify the stats enough to make them feel very meaningful
